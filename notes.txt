Notes:

- I did some reading and decided for a binary classifier, it made more sense to
  use a simple linear model than what I was doing. It also made more sense to
  use a pre-existing Python package to do the ML so I'm using scikit-learn. I'm
  also using logistic regression (a logistic loss function + Stochastic Gradient
  Descent) for the learning algorithm because it seems reasonable and Amazon ML
  uses that for binary classification.
- I couldn't figure out a smart way to pull semantic features (like whether they
  have other loans) so I'm going with a pattern matching approach for now.
